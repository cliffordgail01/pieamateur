MODULES
When you import another python module, or anything in the module, within your script, the code in the imported module gets executed.
So, any executable statements will be executed.
Also, design your code in a good way such that you prevent such things happening when you didn't intend.

To prevent this, any code that you don't intend to get executed when you import a module should be wrapped in the conditional "if __name__ == '__main__'"

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # only execute this block of code if this
        # is the file that i'm currently running (if it's the main file)
        # if this file is imported in another file, the code in this block will not be executed


IMPORT STATEMENT VARIANTS
import module1
import module1 as modulo  # custom name to use instead of defined name
from module1 import function1
from module1 import function1 as fn
from module1 import function1, Class2 # import multiple items by separating by comma
from module1 import *

Printing help/info about an object: use help(obj) - will automatically print stuff about the obj

dir(module_name) - return a list of the names (of variables, functions, classes etc) a module defines


RESTRICTING WHAT IS IMPORTED FROM YOUR FILE
Use __all__ inside your module to restrict what is imported when the wildcard '*' is used for importing everything.
It is a list of strings of names of stuff you've defined.
When importing using the wildcard '*', variable/class/function names starting with an underscore _ will not be imported (alternative to using __all__ array to restrict what gets exported)

In the __init__ file, you can also write code that is general to the package but not specific to any of the submodules or
subpackages and then just use the code as you please.
E.g
    fad
        __init.py__
        baz
            __init__.py
                 bar() # function in __init__.py
            foo
        chad

    from fad import baz
    baz.bar()

__all__ = ['is_user_siged_up', 'signup_user', 'power']

- It tells the readers of the source code — be it humans or automated tools — what’s the conventional public API exposed by the module.
- It lists names to import when performing the so-called wild import: from module import *.


PACKAGE IMPORTING
A package must have the __init__.py file. In this file you can write initialization code for the package.
Can also define what goes inside the __all__ list

sound/ Top-level package
    __init__.py Initialize the sound package
    formats/ Subpackage for file format conversions
        __init__.py
        wavread.py
        wavwrite.py
        aiffread.py
        aiffwrite.py
        auread.py
        auwrite.py
        ...
    effects/ Subpackage for sound effects
        __init__.py
        echo.py
        surround.py
        reverse.py
        ...
    filters/ Subpackage for filters
        __init__.py
        equalizer.py
        vocoder.py
        karaoke.py
        ...

Example import statements from above dir structure:
- import sound.effects.echo - imports the echo module from effects
    When using the above statement in your code you have to write it in full: sound.effects.echo.synthesize()
- from sound.effects import echo
    Alt to above: echo.synthesize()
- from sound.effects.echo import echofilter - import a specific module/variable/class/function from the
    echofilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)
-- Relative imports --
In the surround module you can use these imports:
    from . import echo
    from .. import formats
    from ..filters import equalizer
    
Note that relative imports are based on the name of the current module. Since the name of the main module is always "__main__", modules intended
for use as the main module of a Python application must always use absolute imports.

Note:
When using 'from package import item', the item can be either a submodule (or subpackage) of the package, or some other name defined in the package,
like a function, class or variable. The import statement first tests whether the item is defined in the package; if not, it assumes it is a module
and attempts to load it. If it fails to find it, an ImportError exception is raised.

Contrarily, when using syntax like import item.subitem.subsubitem, each item except for the last must be a package; the last item can be a module
or a package but can’t be a class or function or variable defined in the previous item.
When using a.b.c
    a, b, and c must all be a package or a module.
    a and b must be packages (all items except the last must be packages)
    c can be a package or a module
